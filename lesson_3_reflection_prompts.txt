When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Primarily when using multiple computers for the same project or working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Not all local commit are ready to be shared with the rest of the people on the project.
    Also if it was done automatically a lot of commits would be unnecessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is an exact copy of a repository either in exclusive local repositories or
    from github to local. Forking is similar to cloning but only between github
    repositories and they link back to the original. Branch is when a commit is
    made without affecting the state of the repository before it and has the
    ability to progress indipendently.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With it is easy to resolve conflicts locally and run git diff to help with that.
